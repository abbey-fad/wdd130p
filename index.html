        <p>Nigeria is located on the west coast of Africa and is the most populous black country in the world, bordering
            the North
            Atlantic Ocean, between Benin and Cameroon. Nigeria covers 356,668 sq miles (923,7770 sq kilometers). It is
            about the
            same size as California, Nevada and Utah combined. Nigeria is diverse in people and culture. The history of
            the country
            goes back to 500 BC when the Nok people were the inhabitants. It was the ending of the 15th century European
            explorers
            and traders began their lucrative slave trade with the Yoruba and Benin peoples. In 1861 Lagos was colonized
            by the
            British and 1914, the entire country became The Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Nigeria became
            independent in 1960.</p>
